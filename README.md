## Assembler and Simulator

This project involves two main tasks: developing an assembler to convert text assembly instructions into binary code and creating a simulator to execute the generated binary code. The project integrates understanding of assembly language with practical simulator design.

### Usage

To use this project:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Follow the instructions provided in the `ISA_DESCRIPTION.md`, `Assembler.md`, and `Simulator.md` files for input file formatting and usage.
3. A sample test case has been provided in the text files named `test_file.txt`. The expected output of the assembler can be found in `assembly_output.txt`.

### Instructions

Please ensure to follow the guidelines outlined in the provided documentation for correct usage of the assembler and simulator. Incorrect syntax or input formatting may result in errors or unexpected behavior.

### Files

- `ISA_DESCRIPTION.md`: Description of the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) used in the assembler and simulator.
- `Assembler.md`: Instructions for using the assembler to convert assembly code to binary code.
- `Simulator.md`: Instructions for using the simulator to execute binary code.
- `test_file.txt`: Sample test case for input assembly code.
- `assembly_output.txt`: Expected output of the assembler for the sample test case.
